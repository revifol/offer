                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">If you are like me, you may suffer from thin hair or hair loss. It does get to me sometimes and I do get embarrassed, but I recently found some ways to achieve better hair growth. Of course, there are some really great shampoos for hair growth out there that include zinc, but before we get into that, let me explain some of the key reasons you might be experiencing hair loss.
<div>
</div><div>These can include, but aren’t limited to:
</div><div>
</div><div>What you eat, like McDonald’s and other unhealthy foods
</div><div>Mineral deficiencies
</div><div>Different medication
</div><div>Stress
</div><div>Genetics
</div><div>Around one third of the population suffers from hair loss. Of that third of the population, they are women. So women, listen up! Just like life, there are no guarantees you can completely avoid losing your hair, however, you can always help. In this post, I will give you some of the best ways to help with your hair loss or thinning.
</div><div>
</div><div>Avoid Damaging Your Hair
</div><div>stuck hairbrush
</div><div>It’s important to limit hair damage by minimizing habits that are bad for your hair. Try and avoid using your hair dryer when you don’t need to. If you take shower before bed, dry your hair with a towel instead. Overusing heat on your hair can cause damage to your hair proteins and make it dry to the point that it breaks off.
</div><div>
</div><div>Continuously using a hair dryer can also permanently damage your hair follicles. That goes for your favorite curling irons and flat irons as well. Make sure you don’t brush too hard either. Pulling your hair out consistently can lead to a damaged scalp.
</div><div>
</div><div>Don’t Pull Your Hair So Tight
</div><div>This one might not be the most obvious method to help you avoid thinning hair. Some hairstyles like ponytails, tight braids, cornrows, and plaits cause heavy stress to your hair follicles. If you put your hair into heated rollers, you can also cause some unnecessary hair loss.
</div><div>
</div><div>Not to say you should never do this, but roll your hair occasionally. I am a big fan of curly hair myself. And if you are used to frequently braiding your hair, place two week breaks in between braids and make sure they aren’t put in too tightly. If your head hurts, your braids are probably too tight.
</div><div>
</div><div>Shampoo To Fight Hair Loss
</div><div>shampooing healthy hair
</div><div>Putting the right shampoos in your hair is important. Washing your hair with the right shampoos can help with keeping your scalp and hair clean. One of the reasons you clean your hair is to avoid any infections that could damage your follicles.

</div><div>Want To Boost Your Brain Power And Energy?
</div><div>Omega 3 is critical to brain function as well as our overall well-being, but our body cannot produce it on it's own at significant levels. Consume this from a good Omega 3 Fish Oil Supplement!

</div><div>You don’t necessarily have to wash your hair everyday because the natural oils your scalp produces is actually healthy for your hair. If need be – wash your hair every other day. If you need help gaining back some thickness to your hair, check Amazon for some hair loss products. They are specially formulated to help strengthen and rebuild lost hair.
</div><div>
</div><div>If nothing else, clean hair is always nicer than dirty, matted hair.
</div><div>
</div><div>Be Aware Of The Ingredients
</div><div>Researches have found that the use of shampoos containing 3% of peppermint oil is effective in 92% of hair loss cases. The oil promotes the conservation and vascularization of hair dermal papilla, and is a natural alternative for preventing hair loss.
</div><div>
</div><div>Another great ingredient is ketoconazole, an ingredient that has been shown in clinical trials to act as an anti-inflammatory agent, effective for hair growth.
</div><div>
</div><div>The daily use of at least 1% pyrithione zinc shampoo over a 26-week treatment period, for example, has a positive improvement in hair growth, according to one study done in 2003. You always want to avoid ingredients called parabens in all cosmetics. Parabens have been used in most cosmetics since the 1950’s to prevent the growth of bacteria.
</div><div>
</div><div>But, in the early 90’s they were found to be agents that mimic estrogen in your body, and have been linked to breast cancer!
</div><div>
</div><div>Start Eating Right
</div><div>Hair Loss Foods Infographic
</div><div>You know the saying, “you are what you eat.” That’s a powerful five-word mantra that every culture in every part of the world knows. Eating a healthy breakfast is important. When it comes to healthy hair, eating correctly can directly affect hair growth.

</div><div>Proper nutrition can help prevent hair loss. This is a simple common sense approach to keeping you, your hair, and your scalp healthy. It is possible that hair loss can be slowed by a healthy diet, consisting of vegetables and fruits.
</div><div>
</div><div>Iron Can Help With Hair Loss
</div><div>Iron is an essential mineral that your body needs to survive. If you are not getting enough iron, this can lead to anemia. Anemia can actually disrupt the supply of healthy nutrients to your hair follicles, which in turn can lead to hair loss.
</div><div>
</div><div>There are many sources of iron that you can acquire from healthy foods such as:
</div><div>
</div><div>Red meat
</div><div>Chicken
</div><div>Kale
</div><div>Broccoli
</div><div>Fish
</div><div>Spinach
</div><div>Protein Can Help With Hair Loss
</div><div>Protein is essential for healthy hair. If you are lacking protein, this can be the reason you have dry, weak hair. Getting enough protein will help manage the amount of amino acids strengthening your hair. Eating foods with high amounts of protein is not only good for muscles and other factors, but it is also great for improving the condition of your hair.
</div><div>
</div><div>Some foods you can acquire adequate amounts of protein include:
</div><div>
</div><div>Seafood
</div><div>Poultry
</div><div>Cheese
</div><div>Yogurt
</div><div>Beans
</div><div>Pork
</div><div>Tofu
</div><div>Peanut butter
</div><div>Quinoa
</div><div>Eat Foods Rich In Biotin
</div><div>Biotin is a B vitamin and is important for your hair. If you are not getting enough biotin, your hair could begin to fall out and become brittle. Good sources of biotin include whole grains, liver, egg whites, soy flour, walnuts, and yeast.
</div><div>
</div><div>Whole grains are a great source of zinc as well. Remember when I mentioned some of the best shampoos for hair loss contain zinc? Zinc helps aid with itchy scalp and hair loss. So be sure to eat enough whole grains to help with any issues you may be having with hair loss.
</div><div>
</div><div>Conclusion
</div><div>Overall, a healthy diet can help you avoid hair loss. It will help you gain more volume to your hair. Knowing what you put into your hair is important for future growth. Avoid any unnecessary damage as much as you can. Your hair is one of the first characteristics someone notices about you. Be sure to take care of it and treat it well.</div></h4>
